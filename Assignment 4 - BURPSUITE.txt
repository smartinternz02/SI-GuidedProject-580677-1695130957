----------------------BURPSUITE-------------------------

Burp Suite is a popular cybersecurity testing tool used for web application security assessment and penetration testing. Developed by PortSwigger Web Security, Burp Suite is widely used 
by security professionals, ethical hackers, and developers to identify and address security vulnerabilities in web applications.

FEATURES =

Proxy: 
Burp Suite acts as an intercepting proxy server, allowing users to capture and modify HTTP requests and responses between a web browser and the target web application. This feature is 
useful for analyzing and manipulating web traffic.

Scanner: 
The Scanner module automates the detection of common security vulnerabilities in web applications, including cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and more. It provides detailed reports 
of identified vulnerabilities.

Spider: 
Burp's Spider tool crawls a web application to discover and map its content and structure. This helps testers identify hidden or unlinked pages and resources.

Repeater: 
Repeater enables manual testing by allowing users to send individual requests to the web application and observe the responses. It's useful for fine-tuning attacks or exploring potential vulnerabilities.

Intruder: 
The Intruder module is designed for automating brute-force and dictionary-based attacks against web application parameters. Testers can customize attack payloads and analyze responses.

Sequencer: 
Sequencer analyzes the quality of randomness in web application tokens and session identifiers, helping to identify weak session management vulnerabilities.

Decoder: 
Decoder assists in encoding and decoding data in various formats, such as base64, URL encoding, and more. This is useful for analyzing and manipulating data within requests and responses.

Comparer: 
The Comparer tool allows testers to compare two HTTP responses to identify differences, which can be helpful in identifying potential vulnerabilities or inconsistencies.

Extensibility: 
Burp Suite supports the use of extensions and plugins. Users can develop their custom extensions to add new functionality or automate specific tasks.

Session Handling: 
Burp Suite can manage session cookies and authentication tokens, making it easier to test authenticated areas of a web application.

Reporting: 
It provides detailed and customizable reports of identified vulnerabilities, making it easier to communicate findings to development teams or clients.

Collaboration: 
Burp Suite offers features for team collaboration, allowing multiple testers to work on a project simultaneously and share findings.

Target Scope: 
Users can define the scope of their testing by specifying which parts of a web application should be tested, helping to avoid accidental testing of external websites.

Integration: 
It can be integrated with other security tools and frameworks, such as Metasploit, to enhance the scope and depth of security assessments.


-------------Burp Intruder attack types---------------

Sniper - 
This attack places each payload into each payload position in turn. It uses a single payload set. The total number of requests generated in the attack is the product of the number of positions 
and the number of payloads in the payload set. The Sniper attack is useful for fuzzing a number of request parameters individually for common vulnerabilities.

Cluster bomb - 
This attack iterates through a different payload set for each defined position. Payloads are placed from each set in turn, so that all payload combinations are tested. The total number of requests 
generated in the attack is the product of the number of payloads in all defined payload sets - this may be extremely large. The Cluster bomb attack is useful where an attack requires unrelated or 
unknown input to be inserted in multiple places within the request. For example, when guessing both a username and password.
